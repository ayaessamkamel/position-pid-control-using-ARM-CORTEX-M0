Position PID Control using MKL25Z4 FRDM Board: A PID controller to control the position of the motor on MKL25Z4 FRDM board using Kiel Simulator. 
The microcontroller read the position of the motor using analog encoder and the motor was driven using on-board MKL35Z4 DAC. 
Driver implemented in project: DAC, ADC
